## About
Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve a new programming puzzle each day from December 1st to 25th. This repository contains my solutions written in Go for each day's challenge.

## Solutions
Each day has its own directory, containing the solution for that day's problem.

Example:
- Day 1: [Solution](./day1/)
- Day 2: [Solution](./day2/)
- Day 3: [Solution](./day3/)

## How to Run
To run the solutions locally, clone this repository and navigate to the desired day folder. You can run the Go program using:

```bash
go run dayX/solution.go
